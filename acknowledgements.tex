  \item[Neurodivergent Rebel] I \emph{personally} never liked the puzzle piece I often saw used with autism. She was the first to make me aware there were others like me, and other options in use for identity with neurodiversity.
  \item[Autistic Priest] Suggested the Rainbow Infinity Loop be added to the proposal, provided suggestions for improving the proposal.
  \item[dougfelt] Member of the Noto Emoji team and contributor to Noto Emoji. Made me aware of where to submit a new emoji proposal.
  \item[Enchantrix Brighton] Reminded me that many in the neurodiversity community do not identify with the biological sex often used to assign to assign gender in our culture.
