\section{Images}

The images in this proposal are based on the Google\textsuperscript{\textregistered}
\myhref{https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/}{Noto Color Emoji} font.

It is recommended that existing fonts base their artwork on their existing glyph for
\textbf{BRAIN} \texttt{U+1F9E0}. Monochrome versions of the glyph should just use their
monochrome variant of \textbf{BRAIN} \texttt{U+1F9E0} ignoring the rainbow modifier the
same way many of them handle skin tone modifiers when in monochrome.

\subsection{Zip File}
A zip file can be downloaded from:
\myhref{https://github.com/AliceWonderMiscreations/NeurodiversityEmoji/raw/master/NeurodiversityEmoji.zip}{NeurodiversityEmoji.zip}

\subsection{License}

The Emoji artwork is a derivative of the Noto Emoji \textbf{BRAIN} \texttt{U+1F9E0} glyph
which uses \myhref{https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/blob/master/LICENSE}{Apache License, version 2.0}.
A copy of that license is included in the zip archive.

\subsection{Document}

The form for Emoji Proposals specifies that images for the proposed emoji be included at
the top of this document in both 18x18 and 72x72 pixels.

The zip archive contains the concept art in 1024x1024, 128x128, and 72x72. An 18x18 sample
is not included, that size does not make sense, especially when so many devices have a pixel
density of 2:1 or greater.

With all due respect, that part of the `Form for Emoji Proposals' needs to be modified. I do
not even really understand what it is after, and several example proposals I looked at did
not adhere to the text of that guideline. See the
\myhref{http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16279-person-meditating.pdf}{\textbf{PERSON MEDITATING}}
sample proposal. The images there do not include 18x18 pixel images.

Is it possible that 18 point and 72 point is what was intended? Those are common font sizes.
However many (most?) emojis are not even remotely recognizable at 18 pixels by 18 pixels.
