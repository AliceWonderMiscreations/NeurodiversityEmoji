\section{Images}

The images in this proposal are based on the Google\textsuperscript{\textregistered} \myhref{https://www.google.com/get/noto/help/emoji/}{Noto Color Emoji} font.

It is recommended that existing fonts base their artwork on their existing glyph for \textbf{BRAIN} \texttt{U+1F9E0}. Monochrome versions of the glyph should just use their monochrome variant of \textbf{BRAIN} \texttt{U+1F9E0} ignoring the rainbow modifier the same way many of them handle skin tone modifiers when in monochrome.

\subsection{Zip File}
A zip file can be downloaded from: \myhref{https://github.com/AliceWonderMiscreations/NeurodiversityEmoji}{NeurodiversityEmoji.zip}

\subsection{License}

The Emoji artwork is a derivative of the Noto Emoji \textbf{BRAIN} \texttt{U+1F9E0} glyph which uses \myhref{https://github.com/googlei18n/noto-emoji/blob/master/fonts/LICENSE}{SIL Open Font License, version 1.1}.

\subsection{Document}

The form for Emoji Proposals specifies that images for the proposed emoji be included at the top of this document in both 18x18 and 72x72 pixels. Images with those dimensions are included in the (not yet created) zip file, but do not make sense to me in a PDF document where DPI is the unit of measure, and to be honest, do not make sense to me for anything screen display where a pixel is not a consistent unit of measure with screens that have different pixel densities.

With all due respect, that part of the `Form for Emoji Proposals' needs to be modified. I do not even really understand what it is after, and several example proposals I looked at did not adhere to the text of that guideline. See the \myhref{http://www.unicode.org/L2/L2016/16279-person-meditating.pdf}{\textbf{PERSON MEDITATING}} sample proposal. The images there do not include 18x18 pixel images.

Is it possible that 18 point and 72 point is what was intended? Those are common font sizes.
