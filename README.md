NeurodiversityEmoji
===================

An emoji proposition.

Dear Neurodiverse / Autistic Community,

I am asking a huge favor. I would like to speak for you in a request to the
Unicode Consortium for an Emoji that represents our community, our identity.

Requesting an Emoji is a fairly complex process. The guidelines for such a
request are outlined here:

[Submitting Emoji Character Proposals](https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html)

A very rough draft of my proposal is in this github repository, in the file
`proposal.pdf`

I would like feedback from members of the neurodiverse / autistic community
before this proposal is submitted, since if accepted, the emoji will be used
to represent us all.

If you have any concerns whatsoever, please PLEASE let me know so that they
can properly be addressed.

If you have a github account, you can do so by opening an issue in this
project.

Alternatively you can e-mail me: github@domblogger.net

I want your feedback.

I do not want to speak for the community with this request until I know it is
the will of the community.

Thank you for your time,

Alice Wonder
