\section{Inline Emoji Glyphs}

This document uses several existing emojis that embedded as images.

Unfortunately due to technical aspects of using \TeX{}Live to generate this proposal, the font
these glyphs come from are not properly credited in the PDF metadata.

Someday I hope to be able to do something like
\texttt{\textbackslash{}usepackage[scaled=0.8]\{notoemoji\}}
and have emoji support in \texttt{pdflatex} but that day does not seem
to have yet come. So I cheated and embedded images of the needed glyphs.

The images used for the existing inline emojis were downloaded as
PNG images from \url{https://emojipedia.org/}, a very useful resource
for visually seeing how a particular emoji will render on different
devices when the device or software native font is used to render it.
