\section{Selection Factors --- Inclusion}

\subsection{Compatibility}
Some members of the autistic community currently use \textbf{BRAIN} \texttt{U+1F9E0} to indicate neurodiversity, as it is the closest emoji we currently have that expresses our emerging demographic identity. See figure~\ref{fig:rebel}.

\subsection{Expected Usage Level}

\subsubsection{Frequency}

To be written

\subsubsection{Multiple Usages}

Not all people who are neurodiverse opposed to neurotypical are autistic. That is why \textbf{NEURODIVERSITY} is used for the CLDR short name.

This is meant for them as well if they wish to use it, anyone who is part of the larger neurodiverse community.

We expect this emoji will largely be used by the autistic community but have experienced much exclusion ourselves.

Many who are autistic prefer to identify as neurodiverse simply because of the social stigmas that often accompany the word autistic, such as `autistic behavior' and the official labeling of autism as a mental health disorder rather than as valuable diversity in how to perceive things.

Brain scans and instructive artwork for brains often use colors to indicate different things, whether it is neurotypical or not, see figure \ref{fig:brainparts}. It would not be surprising if some people in the field of neuroscience used this emoji sequence outside of the context of neurodiversity.

\subsubsection{Use in Sequences}

This emoji is a proposed sequence. Off topic, using the \textbf{RAINBOW} \texttt{U+1F308} emoji as a modifier to indicate a spectrum of diversity may however be very beneficial to other groups as well. For example, it is very easy to specify family emojis with different ethnic shades but I have not yet found out how to represent \emph{my} family, which has considerable ethnic diversity. But that is a different topic, just something I thought those reading this proposal might want to think about.

\subsubsection{Breaking New Ground}

I do not believe this section is applicable to this petition.

\subsection{Image Distinctiveness}

A rainbow is frequently used as a visual representation of a spectrum. A rainbow itself is created by diffraction of white light, allowing our eyes to interpret the individual wavelengths that make up the visible spectrum of light and see the beautiful diversity that actually exists within white light that we were unable to perceive without the diffraction of light.

It should not be too difficult for people to figure out the rainbow is acting as a diversity adjective to the \textbf{BRAIN} emoji and understand the neurodiversity context.

A rainbow flag is often used as a symbol of pride by the LGBTQIA and sometimes rainbow colors and patterns are used outside of the context of a flag to indicate LGBTQIA pride. However the \textbf{RAINBOW FLAG} sequence \texttt{U+1F3F3 U+200D U+1F308} is more frequently used for LGBTQIA pride. I do not believe there will be much confusion.

\subsection{Frequency Request}

A search on Twitter for the \textbf{BRAIN} emoji shows frequent, though not exclusive, use of that particular emoji in the context of neurodiversity.

A search on Twitter for the \textbf{JIGSAW} emoji showed some usage of the emoji in the context of neurodiversity, see figure~\ref{fig:covfefe}.

With two different emojis being used in the context of neurodiversity that are not intended to convey neurodiversity, we believe there is sufficient demand for an emoji designed to represent our demographic.
